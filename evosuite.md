## EvoSuite

EvoSuite is an open-source 

* Project Home: <https://www.evosuite.org>
* Documentation: links on project home
* Releases: <https://github.com/EvoSuite/evosuite/releases>

## Example Use

Generating Tests

1. Download `evosuite-1.2.0.jar` from the Releases page
2. Copy it to the bookservice directory 
   - actually you can put the JAR anywhere and refer to it using a path
3. Change to your project directory. Using bookingservice in this example.
4. Build the source code, if necessary
   ```
   gradle compileJava
   ```
   > Gradle creates .class files in build/classes/main/java
5. Use Evosuite to generate tests:
   ```
   java -jar evosuite-1.2.0.jar -target build/classes/main/java
   ```
   > There are other options for using Evosuite, described here:
   > <https://www.evosuite.org/documentation/commandline/>
   >
   Generate tests for only BookingService class:
   ```
   # this should be one line
   java -jar evosuite-1.2.0.jar 
        -projectCP build/classes/java/main/    # source directory
        -prefix bookingservice                 # package for generated tests
        -class bookingservice.BookingSystem    # which class(es) to test
   ```

6. The tests generated by EvoSuite are in directory `evosuite-tests`

There are many options you can set. To see a list use:
```
java -jar evosuite-1.2.0.jar -help
```

To see parameters you can set in a configuration file:
```
java -jar evosuite-1.2.0.jar -listParameters
```

Useful command line options:
```
    # base directory applied as prefix to other paths
    -base_dir src/test/java/
    # classpath of project under tests
    -projectCP
    # package prefix for generated tests
    -prefix bookingservice
    # target class for testing, as fully qualified name
    -class bookingservice.BookingSystem
    # generator types
    -generateRandom
    -generateSuite
    -generateSuiteUsingDSE
    
```

### Running the tests

The tests require EvoSuite code contained in either evosuite-1.2.0.jar or evosuite-standalone-runtime-1.2.0.jar.  The "runtime" version is smaller since it does not contain all the code needed to generate the tests.

You need one of those JARs on the classpath.

So, to run the tests you need:
- the compiled classes for target code (`bookingservice.*`)
- the compiled unit test classes
- evosuite-standalone-runtime.jar or evosuite.jar on the classpath

Add to the `build.gradle` file

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    testImplementation(files("/opt/evosuite/evosuite-standalone-runtime-1.2.0.jar"))
}
```


Limit which tests are run:
```
gradle test --tests bookingservice.SomeTestClass
```
