## Which do you think is a better framework for E2E testing of web applications or web services: Robot Framework or Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit?     

Do you know you can write Robot tests in [Gherkin style](#gherkin-lovers)?

### Anusid

For testing web applications, I think Robot Framework is a better tool. It visualizes how well the web services are performing and provides result files, test logs and the reports of the results for us. However, it's harder to read comparing to Cucumber because of its complex structure.

### Auttakrit

In my opinion Robot Framework is a good framework for testing web applications because it is easier to use, easier to learn, and more flexible to test than Cucumber.

### Bhatara

No comment.

### Bheem
Testing Vaccine Haven Web of 3AM project

I prefer Robot Framework because it easier to write and understand, but I think Cucumber with Selenium is more suitable for complicated work.

### Chanathip

No comment.

### Chayapol

I think Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit is better than Robot Framework for E2E because Cucumber supports Behaviors-Driven Development and it uses Gherkin syntax that is user-friendly.

### Ingkharat

I think robot framework is easy to understand. I prefer to use Robotframework more than Cucumber because it easier to understand, but in some case I think Cucumber has more than accurate.

### Jakkrathorn

I think Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit is better than Robot Framework because Cucumber framework is highly considered due to it’s simple and user friendly usage, Robot Framework has more of complex structure comparing to Cucumber.    

### Kittitouch

I think Cucumber is better than Robot Framework because it's user-friendly and easy to understand but if the test case 
requires a complex algorithm Robot Framework will be better.

### Kongtapp

I think that robot framework is better than cucumber because when testing with robot framework you can see the test working in your browser in real time, and in the terminal also told us very clearly if something goes wrong.

### Metaras

The robot framework are more convenient for E2E testing, and it is simple and easier to understand compare with Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and JUnit.

### Nanthakarn

I prefer `Robot Framework`. Because I can monitoring the steps of test with visual, so I can understand the procedure better when it detected bugs. Also this framework convenient for the tester to test User Interface without knowing code.

### Narawish

My opinion is I prefer to use Robot Framework better because it's less hassle to handle,
Cucumber require a lot more setup to use and selenium is more complex, but Selenium can do complex test but robot framework can do simple test.

### Nutta

In my opinion, Robot framework is better because, compare to Cucumber, test case log are more simplify which makes it easier to read and test section divisions in one file provide better method to run many test consecutively.

### Nuttapol

I think Cucumber is better because it more readable than Robot Framework for non-programmer and it implement the test like a unit test just need the glue code for matching with behavior tests (Gherkin language).

### Panida

Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and JUnit because Cucumber has more user-friendly Gherkin syntax and simplicity, so it's easier to work with.

### Panitan

I think Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit is better than Robot Framework. Because Cucumber framework is highly considered due to it’s more simple and more user friendly to us. Robot Framework has more complex structure comparing to Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit.    

### Patiphan

I think robot framework is easy to use but it also lack of functionality to test more complex function. So I perfer another JS framework more than robot framwork especially since frontend development is mostly based on JS frameworks like Angular, React or Vue.

### Pattarin

For me, Robot Framework is better. The syntax and the way to use is not hard to understand. 
The framework is less complex compare to Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and JUnit.

### Peerasu

I think Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit is better than Robot Framework. Because Cucumber framework is highly considered due to it’s more simple and more user friendly to us. Robot Framework has more complex structure comparing to Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and Junit.    


### Phakarat

Both frameworks have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Robot Framework is my preferred framework over Cucumber because it is simple to set up, write test cases, run test cases, and simply comprehend the results of each test case.

If you fail the test case, a screenshot will be saved in the folder so you can see and easy to understand.

### Phuwanut

In my personal opinion, the Robot Framework is a better choice because it is a lot easier to use and it is more flexible. 

### Pitchapa

I think Robot Framework is better than Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and JUnit because it's a test that has instructions to use to create a test that is easy to read, understand, and clear, although some syntax is maybe a little more complicated but it has a document that clearly provides information and examples of use. It is also a test that is suitable for testing clear and concrete application web pages and testing even the smallest details on that page as well. And there is also a very clever function that when we write a wrong test, Robot Framework will put a screenshot in the folder of where we are wrong and on which page of the web page, which is useful to help us know where did we go wrong.

### Pittayut

I think Robot Framework is better. Because, It has easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach. 

### Purich

I think Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and JUnit is a better framework for E2E testing of web applications or web services because it is simpler and more user friendly to people who have little knowledge in programming language and it is easier to learn, write, and understand than Robot Framework.

### Puvana

Robotframework is quite syntax free for my first time looking, but after trying use it I found that sometime the syntax error and also can't understand why. However it was a nice one of E2E testing I'd ever used. but I'm not sure if it was my fault that can't understood it's document.

### Sahadporn

I think Robot Framework is more suitable since it's a test automation framework for E2E acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development, while Cucumber is more for behavior-driven development. Furthermore, Robot Framework's simple usage and library make it uncomplicated to implement, extending to more than front end, coding form back-end, and custom test can also be done. It provides easy understanding to tester both who know how to code and who don't. Also, being able to manage your test case and data fairly conveniently. 

Personally, I used less time understanding Robot Framework than Cucumber and prefer the neat way Robot Framework provided their report.

### Sahanon

Robot framework is very convenient in searching for hidden elements that are in the nested `div` or `class` which I think is absolutely great!
What I think is the most annoying is the way it uses indentation. You need to use more than 2 indentation to separate the command in each line and sometimes it confused me a lot.

For end to end testing if you are a beginner this tool is very useful and easy to learn but if you can write Javascript then I think Cypress is way better. 

### Sahatsawat

For this case, Robot Framework is the winner. The syntax is the most similar to common sense human language.

### Saruj

I prefer Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and JUnit. I agree that Robot Framework is easier to use; however, it is limited in terms of functionality. If we are going to test more complex features, Cucumber may be a better choice. Moreover, Cucumber allows you to create more flexible Gherkin code and this is what we're looking for in order to conduct E2E testing.

### Settanat

I think it depends on the application that we test. If we consider web application test, then the Robot Framework is better. But if we consider on the system test, the Cucumber is better.

### Siravit

I think Robot Framework is better than Cucumber because Robot Framework is easily extendable and vast scope more than Front End.

### Suchon

I think Robot Framework is a better tool. It is easier to use than cucumber.

### Sujinunt

In my opinion, Robot Framework looks easier to use than Cucumber because Cucumber looks more complex than Robot Framework. With Cucumber we need to have Java file back cucumber but Robot Framework is not and easy to understand how E2E test work like go to url, click button and input value.

### Tatpol

I think Robot Framework is better because it supports Selenium WebDriver to easily locate DOM element on web application and simulate users interaction.

### Teeranut

Robot Framework and Cucumber have a great impact on the project that requires the developer to discuss with stakeholder, which both of them are simple for stakeholder understanding. 
In my opinion, I think that the robot framework is easier to understand and use in both of stakeholder and developer.

### Theetouch

I think they have different approach; Robot is mainly aimed for User Stories Requirements but Cucumber mainly aim for Bussiness Requirements.
If I have to really choose one for end to end testing, I will definitely go with Robot Framework.

### Thornthep

I think Robot Framework is better in terms of visualization, Because we get to see the robot that actually testing the website and know what's happenning in the browser.

### Vichisorn

No comment.

### Gherkin Lovers

You can write Gherkhin-style tests in Robot Framework.  The "keywords" definitions can include variables as done in the Cucumber glue (freature) code.

```
*** Test Cases ***

Can Register for Vaccine
    Given I visit vaccine site homepage
    When I click on link "register"
    Then the page contains "Citizen Registration"

*** Keywords ***
I visit vaccine site homepage
    Open Browser       ${SITE_URL}      ${BROWSER}
    Title Should Be    ${SITE_TITLE}

I click button "${buttonname}"
    Click Button       ${buttonname}

I click on link "${linkname}"
    Click Element      id:${linkname}__link

The page contains "${text}"
    Page Should Contain    ${text}
```
